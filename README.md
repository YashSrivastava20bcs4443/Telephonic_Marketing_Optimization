# Telephonic_Marketing_Optimization

The objective was to optimize term deposit sales by identifying potential customers who were more likely to subscribe. Leveraging client data, including age, job type, and marital status, as well as call information such as call duration and timing, I developed a predictive model. This model enabled the client to target specific individuals through telephonic marketing campaigns, resulting in improved campaign efficiency and increased term deposit subscriptions.
